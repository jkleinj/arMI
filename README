arMI: analytical residual Mutual Information 
--------------------------------------------
Computation of
- Mutual Information (MI)
- analytical residual Mutual Information (arMI)
- numerical residual Mututal Information (nrMI)
of all pairwise data vectors from a sequence alignment.
The program accepts FASTA alignments as input (--mali),
alternatively a random alignment (--random)
of specified depth (--nseq) and length (--lseq)
is created internally .

Alignments
----------
All sequences must be of the same length, gap symbols '.' can be included.
The default base set of 27 symbols is represented by ASCII values [64,90]
or synonymously symbols [@,Z], where '@' is the program-internal gap symbol.

The number of sequences must be in the range [2,1755],
deeper alignments will lead to an assertion exception.

Expression values
-----------------
The row and column names are read in separately from the expression values.
The names must not exceed 63 characters each.
The number of row and column names determines the matrix size of the
expression values and size mismatches lead to program termination.
Expression values are cast into float types and grouped into log2 bins.


Install / Uninstall
-------------------
Please read the general 'INSTALL' instructions.
Otherwise use the following commands:
tar -zxvf arMI-1.1.0.tgz; cd arMI-1.1.0
./configure; make; make check; make install
